# StudentLevels

TO MAKE THIS APP, I USED NODEJS, EXPRESS, GRAPHQL AND MONGODB FOR MY BACKEND AND FOR MY FRONT
I USED REACTJS, APPOLO TO COMMUNICATE WITH MONGODB AND VICTORYJS FOR MY VISUALIZATIONS.

THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A STUDENT AND UNDER THAT STUDENT, HAVE MANY CATAGORIES OF INCIDENT LEVELS.
WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE ID OF THE STUDENT, YOU WILL SEE THE LEVELS LOGGED FOR THAT STUDENT AND A BAR GRAPH DIPLAYING ITS LEVELS.
